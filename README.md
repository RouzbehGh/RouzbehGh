- Hi, I'm Rouzbeh.
- I’m interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Marketing. I graduated bachelor of science in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology. I enjoy being challenged and engaging in projects that require me to work outside of my comfort and skill set, which led me to learn new things.
- I started researching as a senior student; in this regard, I have four research papers and a review paper in NLP. My research mainly aims to improve customer satisfaction by exploring their reviews. I enjoy research about sentiment analysis and customer experiences in using products/services. 
- From my point of view, future marketing strategies depend on measuring customer satisfaction based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially NLP. No one can deny that AI covers all aspects of our life, so we can employ NLP to increase the revenue of a company or organization since people share their attitudes in their reviews. I'm eager to develop my ideas in this field, so do not hesitate to chat with me about this topic.
